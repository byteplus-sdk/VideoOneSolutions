Interactive live streaming incorporates interactive features into the standard live streaming experience. This includes activities such as host PK battle and co-hosting with audience members, providing a more engaging experience than standard live streaming that only allows interaction through text chat and virtual gifts. Interactive live streaming brings the host and audience closer together, resulting in a more immersive and enjoyable experience for both parties.

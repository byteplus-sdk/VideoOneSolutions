 * This Class gives you a uncomplicated way to build a play control view.
 * To achieve this goalï¼Œyou should provide a instance which implement protocol 'MDPlayCoreAbilityProtocol' and 'MDInterfaceElementDataSource'.
 * The protocol 'MDPlayCoreAbilityProtocol' describes the play ability of the player you choose.
 * The protocol 'MDInterfaceElementDataSource' describes the play control UI's detail you want.
 * However, this is a universal tool, so we have to ask for the screen rotation and page back method of your global logic by the protocol 'MDInterfaceDelegate'.
